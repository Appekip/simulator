# simulator
Simulator project using Java. Gui was made with Javafx and with the help of scenebuilder. 
We were allowed to simulate anything we wanted, as long as it had some sort of service desks and queues. We chose an consumer electronics store Gigantti, because I worked there during the development of this project.
